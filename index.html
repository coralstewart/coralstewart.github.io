<h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to my ePortfolio. I am a Computer Science student at SNHU, and this collection of work reflects my growth in the fields of software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Through this capstone experience, I’ve applied innovative enhancements to real-world projects, demonstrating technical depth and the ability to deliver value through code.

<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>For this category, I chose to utilize a project from CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course. It is a mobile weight-tracking app that allows users to track their weight and BMI over time through daily inputs of weight and height. This project was very special to me and I was thrilled to showcase my skills and demonstrate my abilities to implement changes to an existing application. </p>
<p>I chose this artifact to showcase my understanding of software development and design, and my ability to improve a piece of software with planned enhancements. I improved and expanded the original code to clearly demonstrate my knowledge of software engineering principles. These enhancements not only improved the user experience but also cleaned up the original code and made it more reliable and secure. I implemented password hashing using SHA-256 to address any security concerns, as passwords were previously stored in plaintext. I included user input validation before sending entries to the database to prevent data corruption. To increase performance, I removed full reloads of the data entries by optimizing RecyclerView updates using notifyItemInserted(). I also implemented confirmation before deleting entries, to prevent data loss and to improve the user experience. Anticipating any future use of my code, I made it more readable using in-line and JavaDoc comments. </p>
<p>Through the enhancement process, I learned how much of a difference a small design decision can make. For example, using notifyItemInserted() rather than reloading an entire list of entries had a huge impact on performance. I was met with a challenge during my implementation of SHA-256. I had to update the registration logic and the login logic and then debug to ensure everything was running seamlessly. </p>
<p>I met course outcome 2, design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts, by improving documentation with in-line and JavaDoc comments. I also met course outcome 3, design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices, by optimizing RecyclerView updates and implementing user input validation. Course outcome 4, demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals, was met by applying industry standard tools by using RecyclerView.Adapter, AlertDialog, and MessageDigest. The final course outcome I met in this category was course outcome 5, develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources, by implementing secure password hashing with SHA-256. </p>


<h1>Artifact 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>

<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>For this category, I chose to utilize the same project from the CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course, which I took in September 2024. This mobile weight-tracking app allows users to input their weight and height daily, calculating their BMI and storing it in an SQLite database. The original code lacked algorithmic functions and efficient data handling, which was corrected through the enhancements I made. </p>
<p>I included this artifact in my ePortfolio to demonstrate my ability to enhance data structures and implement algorithms in a mobile application. I improved the user experience by implementing a filtering logic so that users could filter their entries based on a user-defined BMI threshold. I also used Java’s Comparator to organize entries by BMI or date. I created a StatsHelper class to calculate summary statistics for users so that they could see their maximum, minimum and average BMI. The final enhancement involved refactoring the BMI calculation logic into the WeightEntry class to promote encapsulation.</p>
<p>During my time enhancing this artifact, I looked at my app from the eyes of a user and really aimed to improve the user experience. I asked myself, “if I were using this app, what might be a feature I’d like to use?” I then decided to add in logic for summary statistics for users to track their minimum, maximum, and average BMI alongside their weight. I faced a challenge when applying the filtering and sorting logic in a way that would fit with the RecyclerView structure. I researched and found the answer to my problem on StackOverflow, realizing the issue was caused by updating the adapter while iterating through the original list. This challenge showed me how to implement list manipulation better and helped me understand adapters more thoroughly. </p>
<p>Course outcome 3, design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices, was met by creating the filtering and sorting logic. I also met course outcome 4, demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals, by improving the user experience and enhancing the app’s functionality and capabilities, which are both key in mobile app development.</p>


<h1>Artifact 3: Databases</h1>

<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>For this final category, I chose the very same artifact as the previous two categories. This mobile weight-tracking app began as a project from the CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course that I took in September of 2024. This app allows users to enter their height and weight daily to calculate their BMI. Users can also filter their entries by BMI and date, and also see their minimum, maximum, and average BMI.</p>
<p> I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it showcases my knowledge of database implementation within a mobile application. I have successfully created SQLite tables with queries that will retrieve entries specific to user ID, secured user passwords using SHA-256 hashing, and across sessions I have maintained data consistency. More specifically, I used Intents to pass the user’s unique ID between activities, which allowed me to display user-specific data pulled from the database. This unique user ID is also used in database queries to filter entries based on the user ID. I also cleaned up database operations by refactoring the DatabaseHelper class to apply input validation. These enhancements modify the user experience and improve security.</p>
<p> During the enhancements for this category, I didn’t even realize that entries were accessible across users. I tested this by using two different logins and found that entries were accessible from multiple users. I tested again after my enhancements and found that entries were only accessible to the user that inputted them. I did run into a challenge with making sure the userId reliably persisted across the various activities without causing pointer exceptions. To resolve this, I used Intent extras to pass the userId and validated it before accessing the database.</p>
<p>Course outcome 3, design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts, was met by filtering data based on user ID and using structured queries. Course outcome 4, demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals, was met by maintaining a consistent, secure user experience across sessions by passing the user’s unique ID between activities. Upon uploading my ePortfolio and publishing it for the public to see, I will satisfy course outcome 1, employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science. </p>
