<h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to my ePortfolio. I am a Computer Science student at SNHU, and this collection of work reflects my growth in the fields of software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Through this capstone experience, Iâ€™ve applied innovative enhancements to real-world projects, demonstrating technical depth and the ability to deliver value through code.

<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>
  This artifact originated in my Mobile Architecture and Programming course. I redesigned the codebase to improve modularity and reduce coupling between activities. I also restructured the logic to handle input validation more securely. These enhancements demonstrate mastery of software engineering principles and align with Course Outcome 3.

<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>
  In this artifact, I optimized the data retrieval system using efficient sorting algorithms and implemented a BMI statistics helper class. This improved both clarity and runtime performance. The work reflects Outcome 3 by applying algorithmic principles to solve practical challenges.

</ul>
<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>
  This enhancement introduced user-specific session state and secure data filtering. I used Intents to preserve login identity and modified SQLite queries to return only user-linked results. This shows proficiency in database management (Course Outcome 4) and attention to secure, scalable design.
