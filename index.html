<h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to my ePortfolio. I am a Computer Science student at SNHU, and this collection of work reflects my growth in the fields of software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Through this capstone experience, Iâ€™ve applied innovative enhancements to real-world projects, demonstrating technical depth and the ability to deliver value through code.

<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>For this category, I chose to utilize a project from CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course. It is a mobile weight-tracking app that allows users to track their weight and BMI over time through daily inputs of weight and height. This project was very special to me and I was thrilled to showcase my skills and demonstrate my abilities to implement changes to an existing application. </p>
<p>I chose this artifact to showcase my understanding of software development and design, and my ability to improve a piece of software with planned enhancements. I improved and expanded the original code to clearly demonstrate my knowledge of software engineering principles. These enhancements not only improved the user experience but also cleaned up the original code and made it more reliable and secure. I implemented password hashing using SHA-256 to address any security concerns, as passwords were previously stored in plaintext. I included user input validation before sending entries to the database to prevent data corruption. To increase performance, I removed full reloads of the data entries by optimizing RecyclerView updates using notifyItemInserted(). I also implemented confirmation before deleting entries, to prevent data loss and to improve the user experience. Anticipating any future use of my code, I made it more readable using in-line and JavaDoc comments. </p>
<p>I met course outcome 2, design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts, by improving documentation with in-line and JavaDoc comments. I also met course outcome 3, design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices, by optimizing RecyclerView updates and implementing user input validation. Course outcome 4, demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals, was met by applying industry standard tools by using RecyclerView.Adapter, AlertDialog, and MessageDigest. The final course outcome I met in this category was course outcome 5, develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources, by implementing secure password hashing with SHA-256. </p>

<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>
  In this artifact, I optimized the data retrieval system using efficient sorting algorithms and implemented a BMI statistics helper class. This improved both clarity and runtime performance. The work reflects Outcome 3 by applying algorithmic principles to solve practical challenges.

<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>
  This enhancement introduced user-specific session state and secure data filtering. I used Intents to preserve login identity and modified SQLite queries to return only user-linked results. This shows proficiency in database management (Course Outcome 4) and attention to secure, scalable design.
